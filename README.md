# Fractals

Repository contains Python scripts generating fractals. These fractals were chosen based on their unique features and recognisability. SImilar fractals that are just variations of included fractals were not implemented. Folder *Outputs* contains examples of images, that can be generated using provided scripts. Gosper and Koch curves were generated via turtle graphics, and the rest using matplotlib library.
